A guide to navigating the user interface will show up in the console when the code is run.

To use the app you must first run Aserve.exe

Next run IAP.ccp  

Follow the instructions in the console window.

Enjoy playing with the synthesiser.

There shouldn't be any errors if the instructions are followed, but if there are exit Aserve and start again.

My contribution to this project is the code written in the files:

IAP/Source/IAP.cpp

These files contain the code that tells executes all of the previously mentioned features.
